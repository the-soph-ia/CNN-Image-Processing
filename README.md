# CNN-Image-Processing
- still a work in progress
- steps:
1. add images to 'queue' folder
2. run 'rename.py' to order data
3. run 'crop.py' to resize and crop data
Then woah! You've got a nice stack of images ready for CNNs!
Optional:
4. run 'double.py' to flip your images and effectively double the size of your training data
