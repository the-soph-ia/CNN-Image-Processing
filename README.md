# CNN-Image-Processing

### Use this simple Python script to clean up your image classification data!
Crops any image into a 255x255 pixel square.


To Use:
1. Create a folder under 'ML Processing' for the object you want to identify ('frogs' if the object is frogs)
2. Within that folder, create three subfolders:
    frogs_queue
    frogs_sorted
    frogs_processed
3. Add your images to the _queue folder
4. Run 'process.py' and watch the processed images appear in the _processed folder!

Then woah! You've got a nice stack of images ready for CNNs!
Optional:
4. run 'double.py' to flip your images and effectively double the size of your training data

(please ignore 'split.py' lol; it just kinda exists)
